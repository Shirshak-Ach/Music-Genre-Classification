# Music-Genre-Classification
This is a basic project I did at my project on Machine Learning when I was joining Fusemachines as an AI Fellow.


Music Classification V1.ipynb file is the updated version of fuse-machines-music-classification.ipynb file where only major details are used.



Also the dataset is extracted from kaggle:
